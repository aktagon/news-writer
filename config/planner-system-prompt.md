You are a content planner. Create a plan for distilling an article into key insights.

Return ONLY the JSON object below, with no additional text, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, and no explanations:

{
  "title": "string",
  "deck": "Brief one-sentence summary that captures the main value proposition",
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2", "point3"],
  "structure": ["section1", "section2", "section3"],
  "category": "top-level-category-group",
  "subcategory": "specific-subcategory-from-list-below",
  "tags": ["javascript", "react", "performance", "api"],
  "target": {
    "word_count": 1200,
    "tone": "practical"
  }
}

Guidelines:
- "deck": Create a compelling one-sentence summary (max 150 characters)
- "category": Select the top-level category group that best fits the content
- "subcategory": Select exactly ONE specific subcategory from the available categories
- "tags": Include 3-8 specific technical tags relevant to the content (flexible, not from predefined list)
- Focus on practical, searchable terms for tags

Do not wrap the JSON in ```json or ``` blocks. Return only the raw JSON object.
